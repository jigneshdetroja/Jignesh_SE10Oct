   				Poly : Many
   				morphism : Forms
   				
   	e.g a bird and aeroplane.
   	
   	2 Types :
   	
   	1) Compile Time Polymorphism
   			- It is also called as Static Polymorphism or Early Binding
   			
   		e.g 1) Method Overloading.
   			2) Operator Overloading.
   			
   	2) Runtime Polymorphism
   			- It is also called as Dynamic Polymorphism or Late Binding.
   			
   		e.g 1) Method Overriding.
