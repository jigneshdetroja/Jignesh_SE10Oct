	A paragraph is a group of related sentences serving three important purposes:
	Paragraphs join together sentences into a unit that works to support an essay’s main idea or thesis.
	Paragraphs provide breaks that allow readers to pause and make sense of what they are reading.
	Paragraphs indicate the movement or development of ideas in an essay. Each new paragraph–or in some cases, clusters of paragraphs–contributes important new information that moves a reader one step closer to an essay’s main idea or thesis.

<h2 align="center" style="background-color: green">Writers use four types of paragraphs</h2>
	Introductory paragraphs identify an essay’s topic, give basic background or contextual information, and indicate the writer’s purpose for writing, approach to the topic (including the scope of treatment), and thesis.
	Body paragraphs provide the main development and support of an essay’s main idea or thesis.
	Transitional paragraphs connect the various body paragraphs together and join the body of an essay to the introduction and conclusion.
	Concluding paragraphs review an essay’s main points, discuss the significance of those points, and sometimes point ahead to future treatments of the topic.
