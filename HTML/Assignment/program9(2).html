<h1>Paragraph</h1>
<p>
	<div>
	A paragraph is a group of related sentences serving three important purposes:
	Paragraphs join together sentences into a unit that works to support an essay’s main idea or thesis.
	Paragraphs provide breaks that allow readers to pause and make sense of what they are reading.
	Paragraphs indicate the movement or development of ideas in an essay. Each new paragraph–or in some cases, clusters of paragraphs–contributes important new information that moves a reader one step closer to an essay’s main idea or thesis.
