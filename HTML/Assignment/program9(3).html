Paragraph Unity and Continuity
Just as paragraphs work together to develop a thesis, the sentences within an effective paragraph support and extend one another to develop a single idea. Thus, you can think of a paragraph as a kind of “mini-essay.” Like a full essay, an effective paragraph:
•	presents a clear main or controlling idea
•	supports or develops that main idea
•	arranges ideas and supporting material in an orderly pattern, and
•	uses logical associations and transitions to link one idea to the next

Paragraph Unity
As a rule, every effective paragraph has an explicit topic sentence, which is stated at or near the beginning and to which all other sentences in the paragraph are logically related. We refer to that logical relationship as paragraph unity. To test for paragraph unity, ask yourself how each sentence of a paragraph helps support or develop the topic sentence of that paragraph. Give a name to the relationship between the two sentences (e.g., exemplification, classification, definition).
